                                <p>The Duolingo English Test (DET) is a modernized language assessment test which has come to the fore due to the current scenario. As with other language assessment tests like IELTS, TOEFL and PTE, the DET tests all the four core language skills of the candidates: Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking. However, the DET has its own revolutionary ways of testing. It is a computer-adaptive test: if you answer a question correctly, the next one gets harder. If you answer it wrong, the next one gets easier.</p>

                            <p>There are several clear benefits that stand in favour of the DET if compared with other tests.</p>
