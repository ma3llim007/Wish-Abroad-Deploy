                            <p>GMAT is a computer adaptive test (CAT) which assesses the analytical, writing, quantitative and verbal skills of students.</p>
                            <p>The maximum score in the GMAT is 800. Typically, students should aim for a minimum score of 600 to succeed in getting admission in a reputed university. Ivy League colleges like Harvard and Stanford typically require scores above 720.</p>
