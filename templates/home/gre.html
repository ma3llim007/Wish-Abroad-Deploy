                                <h3>What is GRE?</h3>
                                <p>The Graduate Record Examination or the GRE is a standardized test that is used to measure the verbal, mathematical, and analytical writing skills of students who wish to do their graduate studies abroad.</p>
                                <p>The test helps to assess the potential of the applicant for advanced study. The GRE score is used by graduate schools in different countries to select applicants. Students applying to these universities must submit their GRE scores with their application.</p>
                                <p>This is a computer-based test where each student will get a unique set of questions. The maximum score for GRE is 340. However, the GRE score is not the only criteria which will determine the applicantâ€™s admission to a university. The test is only one of the factors that is taken into consideration.</p>
                                <br><hr>
                                <h3>What Is The Eligibility Criteria For GRE?</h3>
                                <p>Applicants for the test need to have only a valid passport to take the GRE exam. The exam does not require a minimum qualification or age requirement. The tests are conducted at Prometric Testing Centers located across the country.</p>

                                <h3>What Is The GRE Exam Like?</h3>
                                <p>The GRE exam consists of 3 modules:</p>
                                <div class="container">
                                    <li>Analytical Writing</li>
                                    <li>Verbal Reasoning</li>
                                    <li>Quantitative Reasoning</li>
                                </div>
                                <p>There is an option to either take a paper-based or computerized test. The Analytical Writing module is the first section in the test while the others are presented in a random order. There may also be un-scored sections in the tests. The duration of the test is about 3 hours and 45 minutes.</p>
