                                <h3>PTE – Pearson Test of English</h3>
                                <p>The Pearson Test of English (PTE) is an English language test on similar lines as the IELTS and the TOEFL.

The grading system used in PTE ensures a better level of understanding of the candidate’s proficiency in the English language.</p>
                                <p>Since the PTE is a computer-based test the results are usually given within 5 business days from the test date. Some candidates receive the score within 3 days and some even within a day.</p>
