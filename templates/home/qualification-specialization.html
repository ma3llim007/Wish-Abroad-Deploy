                            <p>These programs are designed as a combination of Masters along with doctorate degree. The basic qualification required for admission is a Bachelor’s Degree in the related discipline. These are offered to exceptional candidates who have huge potential and ability to excel in high performance environment. The purpose of the integrated Phd is to gradually condition one’s thoughts towards research, while providing a view of the trials and tribulations in small doses. So when one joins an Int. PhD program, just in 2-3 months, one is shuttled from a semester-and-exam based system to one where you are learning skills and tools all the time, with evaluations based on presentation, data talks and discussions. These programs are offered across all disciplines i.e. Computer Science/All Engineering/Life Sciences etc… and are of 4-5 years duration. PHD : Doctorate degrees are offered after completion of Masters Degree. You’ll learn more in the first year of Int. PhD than you ever will in the first year of any other degree. The fact that mostly premier institutes offer this program ensures that the student would be exposed to cutting-edge technology, world-renowned speakers and an internationally trained faculty. Since the requirements are tough and the course is purely research Based, admissions criteria are usually very stringent. The normal duration of the Phd Program is 5 years. These programs are offered across all disciplines i.e. Computer Science/All Engineering/Life Sciences etc…. Most of the times students are eligible for fellowships while pursuing their Phd’s.</p>
